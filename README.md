🆘 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Q: Portfolio shows "Demo Data" instead of live data
A: This is normal if Yahoo Finance APIs are temporarily unavailable. The system automatically falls back to simulated data and will resume live data on the next refresh.
Q: Manual refresh button doesn't seem to work
A: The refresh button bypasses the 5-minute timer and fetches immediately. Look for the "Refreshing..." text and spinning icon during the refresh process.
Q: Some stocks show mixed data
A: When some stocks fail to fetch from Yahoo Finance, the system shows live data for available stocks and simulated data for others, clearly marked with badges.
Q: Charts don't update after refresh
A: Charts are automatically updated when new data is fetched. Check the data source badges to confirm live data is being received.
Debug Steps

Check browser console for any error messages
Verify internet connection
Try manual refresh using the header button
Check data source badges for current status
Wait for next auto-refresh cycle (5 minutes)
